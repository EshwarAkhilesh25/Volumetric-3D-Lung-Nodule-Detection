# Volumetric-3D-Lung-Nodule-Detection

Lung Nodule Analysis using Deep Learning and Computer Vision

Project Overview

This repository is part of our initiative to understand and apply deep learning techniques in computer vision. Specifically, we focus on analyzing medical images of lung nodules to explore how AI can assist in medical diagnostics. As part of our learning journey, we aim to experiment with existing models and propose our custom model in future iterations.

Key Features

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Efficient loading of lung nodule datasets.

Augmentation techniques to increase data variability and improve model robustness.

Model Implementation:

Utilization of pretrained deep learning models for initial experimentation.

Implementation of state-of-the-art architectures relevant to medical imaging.

Evaluation Metrics:

Use of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

Custom Model Design (Upcoming):

Proposing a new architecture optimized for lung nodule detection and analysis.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of annotated lung CT images. While specific preprocessing steps and transformations are applied, the raw data should comply with medical imaging standards (e.g., DICOM or NIfTI formats).

Preprocessing Steps:

Image resizing and normalization.

Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.

Application of augmentation strategies such as rotation, zooming, and flipping.

Model Pipeline

Data Loading: Reading and transforming lung nodule data for compatibility with the model.

Training: Fine-tuning pretrained models or training from scratch.

Validation and Testing: Rigorous evaluation using a separate dataset.

Visualization: Heatmaps, ROC curves, and other diagnostic plots to interpret results.
